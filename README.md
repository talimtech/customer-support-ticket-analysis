Customer Support Ticket Analysis
* Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing customer support ticket data to understand issue patterns, resolution efficiency, and SLA performance.
The analysis demonstrates end-to-end data analytics skills using SQL, Python, Excel, and Tableau.

* Dataset

Records: 5,000+ customer support tickets

Key fields: Issue Category, Priority, Resolution Time, SLA Breach, CSAT, Agent, Region

* Tools & Technologies

SQL – Data extraction and KPI queries

Python (Pandas, Matplotlib) – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & descriptive statistics

Excel / Google Sheets – Pivot tables and SLA breach percentage calculation

Tableau Public – Interactive dashboard for visualization

* Analysis Performed
1️ Python – Exploratory Data Analysis

Issue category distribution

Resolution time analysis (mean, median, standard deviation, percentiles)

Identification of long-tail delays

Relationship between resolution time and customer satisfaction (CSAT)

2️ Excel – SLA Analysis

Created helper column to calculate SLA breach flag

Calculated priority-wise SLA breach percentage

Identified higher SLA risk in medium-priority tickets

3️ Tableau – Dashboard

Created an interactive dashboard with:

Ticket Volume by Issue Category

Average Resolution Time by Issue

SLA Breach Percentage by Priority

Bug Reports and Account Updates generate the highest ticket volume

Certain issue categories take longer to resolve, indicating higher complexity

Medium-priority tickets show the highest SLA breach percentage

Resolution time variability highlights operational inefficiencies

* Business Value

This analysis helps support teams:

Identify high-volume and high-impact issues

Monitor SLA risks by priority

Improve resolution efficiency and customer satisfaction

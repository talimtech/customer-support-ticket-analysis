Customer Support Ticket Analysis
🔹 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing customer support ticket data to understand issue patterns, resolution efficiency, and SLA performance.
The analysis demonstrates end-to-end data analytics skills using SQL, Python, Excel, and Tableau.

🔹 Dataset

Records: 5,000+ customer support tickets

Key fields: Issue Category, Priority, Resolution Time, SLA Breach, CSAT, Agent, Region

🔹 Tools & Technologies

SQL – Data extraction and KPI queries

Python (Pandas, Matplotlib) – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & descriptive statistics

Excel / Google Sheets – Pivot tables and SLA breach percentage calculation

Tableau Public – Interactive dashboard for visualization

🔹 Analysis Performed
1️⃣ Python – Exploratory Data Analysis

Issue category distribution

Resolution time analysis (mean, median, standard deviation, percentiles)

Identification of long-tail delays

Relationship between resolution time and customer satisfaction (CSAT)

2️⃣ Excel – SLA Analysis

Created helper column to calculate SLA breach flag

Calculated priority-wise SLA breach percentage

Identified higher SLA risk in medium-priority tickets

3️⃣ Tableau – Dashboard

Ticket Volume by Issue Category

Average Resolution Time by Issue

SLA Breach Percentage by Priority
